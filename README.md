# Accident Casualties Dashboard

## Overview
The **Accident Casualties Dashboard** is a data visualization project built in Tableau. This dashboard provides insights into road accidents, casualty statistics, and related parameters. The goal is to help users analyze accident data and identify patterns for improved road safety planning and management.

## Features
- **Dynamic Filters:** Users can filter by accident severity and year for focused analysis.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Quick insights into total accidents, casualties, and fatality trends.
- **Data Visualizations:**
  - Monthly trends for accidents and casualties.
  - Fatalities by vehicle type, road surface, weather conditions, and road type.
  - Geographical distribution of accidents on a map.
- **Comprehensive Parameters:** The dashboard includes various parameters to analyze accidents in detail.

## Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project contains detailed records of road accidents. Due to its large size(about 90 MB), it is hosted on Google Drive and can be accessed through the link below:
